# AccentureExcercise

1) Write a program in Python or Java that counts backwards from 100 to 1 and prints: “Agile” if the number is divisible by 5,
“Software” if the number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both, or prints just the number if none of those
cases are true.

2) Use your preferred test automation tool to automate test case: Go to your favorite e-shop, navigate to some category
 and add two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category. Provide code from implementation.

For second task the test case should follow same standards and best practices as if it was a real project.
